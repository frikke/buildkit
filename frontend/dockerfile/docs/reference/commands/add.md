title: ADD command
keywords: build, dockerfile, reference

ADD has two forms:

```dockerfile
ADD [--chown=<user>:<group>] <src>... <dest>
ADD [--chown=<user>:<group>] ["<src>",... "<dest>"]
```

The latter form is required for paths containing whitespace.

> **Note**

> The `--chown` feature is only supported on Dockerfiles used to build Linux containers,
> and will not work on Windows containers. Since user and group ownership concepts do
> not translate between Linux and Windows, the use of `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/group` for
> translating user and group names to IDs restricts this feature to only be viable
> for Linux OS-based containers.

The `ADD` instruction copies new files, directories or remote file URLs from `<src>`
and adds them to the filesystem of the image at the path `<dest>`.

Multiple `<src>` resources may be specified but if they are files or
directories, their paths are interpreted as relative to the source of
the context of the build.

Each `<src>` may contain wildcards and matching will be done using Go's
[filepath.Match](https://golang.org/pkg/path/filepath#Match) rules. For example:

To add all files starting with "hom":

```dockerfile
ADD hom* /mydir/
```

In the example below, `?` is replaced with any single character, e.g., "home.txt".

```dockerfile
ADD hom?.txt /mydir/
```

The `<dest>` is an absolute path, or a path relative to `WORKDIR`, into which
the source will be copied inside the destination container.

The example below uses a relative path, and adds "test.txt" to `<WORKDIR>/relativeDir/`:

```dockerfile
ADD test.txt relativeDir/
```

Whereas this example uses an absolute path, and adds "test.txt" to `/absoluteDir/`

```dockerfile
ADD test.txt /absoluteDir/
```

When adding files or directories that contain special characters (such as `[`
and `]`), you need to escape those paths following the Golang rules to prevent
them from being treated as a matching pattern. For example, to add a file
named `arr[0].txt`, use the following;

```dockerfile
ADD arr[[]0].txt /mydir/
```


All new files and directories are created with a UID and GID of 0, unless the
optional `--chown` flag specifies a given username, groupname, or UID/GID
combination to request specific ownership of the content added. The
format of the `--chown` flag allows for either username and groupname strings
or direct integer UID and GID in any combination. Providing a username without
groupname or a UID without GID will use the same numeric UID as the GID. If a
username or groupname is provided, the container's root filesystem
`/etc/passwd` and `/etc/group` files will be used to perform the translation
from name to integer UID or GID respectively. The following examples show
valid definitions for the `--chown` flag:

```dockerfile
ADD --chown=55:mygroup files* /somedir/
ADD --chown=bin files* /somedir/
ADD --chown=1 files* /somedir/
ADD --chown=10:11 files* /somedir/
```

If the container root filesystem does not contain either `/etc/passwd` or
`/etc/group` files and either user or group names are used in the `--chown`
flag, the build will fail on the `ADD` operation. Using numeric IDs requires
no lookup and will not depend on container root filesystem content.

In the case where `<src>` is a remote file URL, the destination will
have permissions of 600. If the remote file being retrieved has an HTTP
`Last-Modified` header, the timestamp from that header will be used
to set the `mtime` on the destination file. However, like any other file
processed during an `ADD`, `mtime` will not be included in the determination
of whether or not the file has changed and the cache should be updated.

> **Note**
>
> If you build by passing a `Dockerfile` through STDIN (`docker
> build - < somefile`), there is no build context, so the `Dockerfile`
> can only contain a URL based `ADD` instruction. You can also pass a
> compressed archive through STDIN: (`docker build - < archive.tar.gz`),
> the `Dockerfile` at the root of the archive and the rest of the
> archive will be used as the context of the build.

If your URL files are protected using authentication, you need to use `RUN wget`,
`RUN curl` or use another tool from within the container as the `ADD` instruction
does not support authentication.

> **Note**

> The first encountered `ADD` instruction will invalidate the cache for all
> following instructions from the Dockerfile if the contents of `<src>` have
> changed. This includes invalidating the cache for `RUN` instructions.

`ADD` obeys the following rules:

- The `<src>` path must be inside the *context* of the build;
  you cannot `ADD ../something /something`, because the first step of a
  `docker build` is to send the context directory (and subdirectories) to the
  docker daemon.

- If `<src>` is a URL and `<dest>` does not end with a trailing slash, then a
  file is downloaded from the URL and copied to `<dest>`.

- If `<src>` is a URL and `<dest>` does end with a trailing slash, then the
  filename is inferred from the URL and the file is downloaded to
  `<dest>/<filename>`. For instance, `ADD http://example.com/foobar /` would
  create the file `/foobar`. The URL must have a nontrivial path so that an
  appropriate filename can be discovered in this case (`http://example.com`
  will not work).

- If `<src>` is a directory, the entire contents of the directory are copied,
  including filesystem metadata.

> **Note**
>
> The directory itself is not copied, just its contents.

- If `<src>` is a *local* tar archive in a recognized compression format
  (identity, gzip, bzip2 or xz) then it is unpacked as a directory. Resources
  from *remote* URLs are **not** decompressed. When a directory is copied or
  unpacked, it has the same behavior as `tar -x`, the result is the union of:

    1. Whatever existed at the destination path and
    2. The contents of the source tree, with conflicts resolved in favor
       of "2." on a file-by-file basis.

  > **Note**
  >
  > Whether a file is identified as a recognized compression format or not
  > is done solely based on the contents of the file, not the name of the file.
  > For example, if an empty file happens to end with `.tar.gz` this will not
  > be recognized as a compressed file and **will not** generate any kind of
  > decompression error message, rather the file will simply be copied to the
  > destination.

- If `<src>` is any other kind of file, it is copied individually along with
  its metadata. In this case, if `<dest>` ends with a trailing slash `/`, it
  will be considered a directory and the contents of `<src>` will be written
  at `<dest>/base(<src>)`.

- If multiple `<src>` resources are specified, either directly or due to the
  use of a wildcard, then `<dest>` must be a directory, and it must end with
  a slash `/`.

- If `<dest>` does not end with a trailing slash, it will be considered a
  regular file and the contents of `<src>` will be written at `<dest>`.

- If `<dest>` doesn't exist, it is created along with all missing directories
  in its path.
